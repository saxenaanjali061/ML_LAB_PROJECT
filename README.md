Project Overview
This project applies Machine Learning models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and SVM) to predict the mechanical properties of steel such as yield strength and tensile strength.  
The dataset is taken from research work on steel alloys.

Aim
To analyze the effect of different alloying elements (Carbon, Manganese, Chromium, etc.) on the strength of steel using ML algorithms.

 Dataset
- Source: [Original GitHub Repo](https://github.com/A158-debug/Prediction-of-Mechanical-properties-of-Steel)  
- Contains chemical composition features and mechanical properties like:
  - Yield Strength
  - Tensile Strength
  - Elongation

 Methods Used
1. Linear Regression – for predicting yield strength.  
2. Logistic Regression – for classification tasks.  
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM) – for classification and prediction.  

  Results
- Linear Regression gave performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).  
- Logistic Regression and SVM results are reported as accuracy and classification performance.  
- Visualization includes scatter plots and regression lines.
